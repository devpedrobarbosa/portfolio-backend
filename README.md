# Portfolio API
> This API was developed for my personal website ([link](https://pedrao.tech/)).

It is based on Spring Boot (**Java**) and is quite simple.

These are some of the skills that I used to build it:
1. Object-oriented programming in Java
2. Use of MVC design pattern
3. Use of the Spring Boot framework
4. Use of Spring Boot ORM solution
5. Use of MongoDB to store data
6. Password encryption
7. Data transfer objects
8. API Security concepts
9. CORS configuration
10. Swagger documentation

*Note: not 100% of the source code is public due to safety reasons, since this API is currently running in production.*
